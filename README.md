# Rapid-Rescue-Network
A reporting portal for incident and crime awareness for the citizens to report any activity witnessed by them for safety and security purposes 
The project is developed in the MERN stack [Mongodb Expressjs React Nodejs] with an eye catching user interface.

Problem : - When a citizen witnesses something terrible happening somewhere or to someone he/she cant go to police for every issue 
            Lets say if an earthquake hits your hometown and lots of people are involved then police cant do much of a help you need assistance of
            Disaster Management Organization. Another example if u saw an Animal is wounded and stuck somewhere you will call Animal Rescue Department
            
            We need different authorities for handling different events 

Solution : - To create a system which is able to collect the data of all the incidents and provide citizens a means to actively participate for the social 
             safety cause and maintaining the peace
